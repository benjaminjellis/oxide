# oxide 
oxide is a simple, high-performance ML library for Rust, inspired by scikit-learn.

## Setup

oxide uses [ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust) as a backend, to use ArrayFire you first need to install the binaries.
Instructions for this can be found [here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust#use-from-cratesio--). Using ArrayFire means oxide can run on OpenCL, CUDA and CPU devices.

## Examples

Examples will follow soon!

## Contributions

oxide is under active development, and a list of features to build for v0.1 is available in the issues of this repository. 
Contributions are very welcome, please see the Contributing.md.
